How does the internet work? 
    The internet is basically a series of requests and responses. When you open up an application such as Chrome, Firefox, or Edge and land on a home page, you are viewing several things at once. First you'll be given a structure of a document, the pieces of which have been marked up using html and stylized using css code. Some of the elements on the page are hard-coded to react when you take certain actions, like clicking links or hovering over images. But many of the elements on the page are actually responding to queries that began when the page loaded. And this process of response is also sending you back data whenever you search for something on the web. As a user you ask to see something, the web page sends that request to a server that is hosting whatever website you are on, and sends back the data you asked for. It's a promise kept. 
What happens when you click on a link?
    When you click on a link, the page's javascript listens for that action and then calls a particular function to do something. Usually, you are taken to the page listed as the source for for that particular link. The link will include the http(s) protocal, the domain name for the site you wish to reach, and the endpoint location being referenced. It may also include query information that helps identify particular information in a database that you want to see.
